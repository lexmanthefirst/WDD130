        <p>Hello, my name is Alex Okhitoya, and I reside in Port Harcourt, Nigeria. I am dedicated to achieving success
            and possess
            an innate determination to succeed. Currently, I am a student at Brigham Young University-Idaho, where I am
            pursuing a
            degree in Web Design and Development. Known for my strong work ethic, I am a diligent individual who thrives
            on
            acquiring new knowledge. I excel as a team player and thoroughly enjoy collaborating with others. My adept
            listening
            skills and passion for assisting people make me a valuable resource within any team. Beyond my academic
            pursuits, I am
            actively involved in various extracurricular activities, including web development projects and volunteering
            in
            community service. These experiences have honed my problem-solving skills and my ability to adapt to diverse
            situations,
            further fueling my passion for technology and its potential to make a positive impact in the world. </p>

        <h2>NIGERIA</h2>

        <p>Nigeria, officially the Federal Republic of Nigeria, is a diverse country in western Africa. Covering 356,669
            square
            miles with a population of 222.5 million, it boasts over 250 ethnic groups, including Hausa, Fulani, Yoruba,
            and Igbo.
            English and Hausa are the official languages, and Christianity, Islam, and traditional beliefs are
            prevalent. The
            economy relies on petroleum, agriculture, and a growing manufacturing sector. Nigeria gained independence in
            1960,
            experienced military coups, and endured a civil war (1967–70). The capital moved to Abuja in 1991, and
            civilian rule was
            reinstated in 1999. Challenges persist, including ethnic strife, protests over oil production, and tensions
            between
            Muslims and Christians.</p>
