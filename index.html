        <p>Nigeria, officially the Federal Republic of Nigeria, is a diverse country in western Africa. Covering 356,669
            square
            miles with a population of 222.5 million, it boasts over 250 ethnic groups, including Hausa, Fulani, Yoruba,
            and Igbo.
            English and Hausa are the official languages, and Christianity, Islam, and traditional beliefs are
            prevalent. The
            economy relies on petroleum, agriculture, and a growing manufacturing sector. Nigeria gained independence in
            1960,
            experienced military coups, and endured a civil war (1967–70). The capital moved to Abuja in 1991, and
            civilian rule was
            reinstated in 1999. Challenges persist, including ethnic strife, protests over oil production, and tensions
            between
            Muslims and Christians.</p>
